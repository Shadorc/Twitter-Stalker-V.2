<h2>Helping with translation</h2>

Best way would be to contact us using Twitter (@Shad0rc or @Dasporal) because you're probably going to have a lot of questions when translating.

I'm using ResX Resource Manager Visual Studio standalone when translating to other languages:
<br>https://resxresourcemanager.codeplex.com/releases (ClickOnce Installer)

Download the project as a ZIP [here](https://github.com/Shadorc/Twitter-Stalker-V.2/archive/master.zip).
<br>Extract it and open ResX Resource Manager. 
<br>At the top left, click on "Directory" and select the folder previously extracted.

You just need to use this software/extension and set columns to your language.
<br>Once finished, create a pull request or contact us on Twitter.
