<h1>Helping with translation</h1>

Best way would be to contact us using Twitter (@Shad0rc or @Dasporal) because probably you are going to have a lot of questions to ask when translating.

I'm using ResX Resource Manager Visual Studio extension when translating to other languages:

Standalone version of it also exist here:
<br>https://resxresourcemanager.codeplex.com/releases (ClickOnce Installer)

You just need to use this software/extension and set columns to your language.
<br>Once finished, create a pull request or contact us on Twitter.

<b>Thanks !</b>
